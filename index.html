<div class="headline"><h1> The Polarization of Nassau County </h1></div>

    <p>With the election of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani to the highest seat of power in New York City, many around the country assume the surrounding area is starkly Democratic. That assumption is far from correct, as one of its two bordering neighbors, Nassau County, saw 62% of votes in its executive races go to Republicans this year. That’s the most on Long Island — which comprises Nassau and Suffolk counties — since 2011.</p>

    <p>While Donald Trump flipped both counties red in the 2024 Presidential Election, Nassau seems to be sticking with the Republicans despite there being 71,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in the county. The GOP won 26 out of 36 races, sweeping all executive positions, for a win percentage of 72%.</p>

    <p>Suffolk, meanwhile, voted 55% in favor of Democrats in their executive races, their highest mark since 2011; mirroring Democrat wins across the country as approval of Trump’s second term thus far reaches <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/29/trump-approval-rating-low-gallup/87524482007/">record lows</a>. Democrats won 19 out of 44 races this year, with five of those being executive races. That, however, is not the best way to show parity between the two counties on Long Island. It's the lack of options outside of Republicans and Democrats.</p>

    <iframe title="The Extreme Lack of Parity in Nassau County" aria-label="Grouped column chart" id="datawrapper-chart-vU42y" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vU42y/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="608" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

    <p>John Georgopoulos, CEO of <a href="https://www.distantwarrior.com">Distant Warrior Productions</a> and distinguished member of the Libertarian Party of New York, was not surprised by this. He noted that a lack of third party representation is by design.</p>

    <p>“The only reason the Conservative and Working Families Party exist is because they always align with the Republican and Democrat. It provides the illusion of third-party choice,” said Georgopoulos. “Republicans and Democrats will always agree on this one issue: no third-party challenges to their rule.”</p>

    <p>He also mentioned how third-party candidates face added legal hurdles, such as needing triple the signatures to get on the ballot, and <a href="https://lpny.org/2023/04/13/libertarian-and-green-parties-petition-to-supreme-court-in-ballot-access-case/">recently increased</a> thresholds to keep any eligibility. This makes New York the hardest state to run as a legitimate third option, he said, but someone with access to money like Andrew Cuomo and his “Fight and Deliver" party can easily get around the red tape.</p>

    <p>While the fight for increased third-party options is a national one, Nassau County might be a perfect example of what a polarized environment does. Despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans by 71,000, they don’t vote in numbers, which points to a dissatisfaction with the Nassau Democrats. Independents could challenge these establishment Democrats, as we just saw Zohran Mamdani do, all the way to Gracie Mansion.</p>
